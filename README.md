## 🖼️ Profile Image Setup

**To use your actual profile image:**

1. **Convert your CR2 image** to JPEG format:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using PowerShell script
   .\convert_image.ps1

   # Option 2: Using batch file
   .\convert_image.bat

   # Option 3: Manual conversion (if ImageMagick is installed)
   magick "uploads/2Z1A2029.CR2" -resize 400x400 -quality 85 "public/profile-image.jpg"
   ```

2. **Alternative methods:**
   - Use online converters like [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/cr2-to-jpg) or [Convertio](https://convertio.co/cr2-jpg/)
   - Open the CR2 file in Photoshop/Lightroom and export as JPEG
   - Use Windows Photos app to convert (if supported)

3. **Place the converted image** as `public/profile-image.jpg`
